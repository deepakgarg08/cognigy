I got some issues

1) Sometimes your-server is replying to first default message "hello" instantly, sometimes it hangs on terminal and give response after a long time (in minutes, sometimes feels like hanged)

2)Reponse received from the server is not continuous i.e it sends first response after some delay it send another response, because of that prompt is causing problem, because our prompt was waiting for the input, but your response is converted into input, therefore whatever you type again replicates.

Well, everything is implemented and working fine, though code needs some optimization one with the prompt package.

I have put two output screenshots

Another thing, I have important Exam tomorrow in universtiy, so I can not devote more time, but this problem is solvable.
